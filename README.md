## ðŸ“˜Organizing MySQL Solutions in GitHub
Create Subfolders for Each Problem: Inside your repository, you can create subfolders for each MySQL problem or category of problems (e.g., Basic Queries, Joins, Window Functions).

Example structure:
LeetCode-MySQL-Solutions/
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ Basic-Queries/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Problem1.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Problem2.md
â”œâ”€â”€ Joins/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Problem1.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Problem2.md
â””â”€â”€ Window-Functions/
    â”œâ”€â”€ Problem1.md
    â””â”€â”€ Problem2.md

 
### Folder Breakdown:

1. **Basic-Queries**: Contains solutions to simple SQL queries like selecting data, filtering, sorting, and basic aggregation.
2. **Joins**: Includes SQL problems that require using various types of joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, etc.).
3. **Window-Functions**: Solutions to problems that involve window functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, etc.).

## ðŸ“„ Documenting Each Solution

Each problem is documented in a `.md` (Markdown) file. These files provide a detailed explanation of the problem and the approach used to solve it. Below is the structure used to document each problem:

### Example Problem Documentation Structure:

#### **Problem Title**
   - **Problem Description**: A brief explanation of the problem statement and requirements.
   - **Approach**: Explanation of the approach used to solve the problem. Mention any key strategies like subqueries, joins, aggregation, etc.
   - **SQL Query**: The final MySQL query solution to the problem.
   - **Explanation of the Query**: A detailed breakdown of how the query works, including any specific clauses and why they are used.
